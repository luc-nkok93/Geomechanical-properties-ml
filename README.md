# Geomechanical-properties-ml
This study is to implement and validate machine learning models to predict geomechanical properties such as shear wave velocity, compressive wave velocity, Poisson's ratio and estimating Young's modulus, and shear modulus for a well located in the little knife field in the Williston basin.
